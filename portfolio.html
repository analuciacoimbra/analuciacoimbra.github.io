      <h2>How do people prepare their grocery shopping?</h2>
      <p>
        A comprehensive generative research study conducted in 2024/25 as a
        volunteer UX Researcher to understand user behaviours, needs and pain
        points in grocery shopping preparation. The research explored how people
        decide where to shop, manage budgets and leverage promotions. Findings
        informed the development of a price comparison tool that helps users
        save money by tracking product prices across different supermarkets.

      <h2>How do therapists manage their daily practice?</h2>
      <p>
        A generative study I carried out during my participation in the
        "Empreende JÃ¡" initiative (an entrepreneurship programme) in 2017, which
        allowed me to better understand the pains and needs of therapists. This
        study was used as the basis for the business plan presented at the end
        of the programme under the project name "Inspiring Care".
