        Hello! I'm Ana Lúcia and welcome to my portfolio!
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm a UX researcher with a background/experience in healthcare and tech.
        I'm passionate about analysing what's behind every inch of human
        behaviour so that I can help in the best way and provide the best
        possible experience. People are driven by motivations and needs and it's
        my job to discover them so that I can inform stakeholders and thus
        contribute to better user-centric products and services. What I bring to
        the table is my resourcefulness, my versatility and adaptability, and my
        thirst for knowledge, along with the desire to always do better and be
        better.

        A comprehensive generative research study conducted in 2024/25 as a
        volunteer UX Researcher to understand user behaviours, needs and pain
        points in grocery shopping preparation. The research explored how people
        decide where to shop, manage budgets and leverage promotions. Findings
        informed the development of a price comparison tool that helps users
        save money by tracking product prices across different supermarkets.

        A generative study I carried out during my participation in the
        "Empreende Já" initiative (an entrepreneurship programme) in 2017, which
        allowed me to better understand the pains and needs of therapists. This
        study was used as the basis for the business plan presented at the end
        of the programme under the project name "Inspiring Care".
