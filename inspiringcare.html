  <h2>Context:</h2>
  <p>
    In 2017/18, during my participation in the “Empreende Já” program (a
    Portuguese entrepreneurship program that is conducted by IPDJ, the
    governmental agency for youth and sports), each participant had classes
    related to business and, afterwards, would have to present a business plan
    to be evaluated by a jury.
  </p>
  <p>
    I joined the program to be able to learn more about
    business/entrepreneurship, since it was something I was interested in, and
    possibly develop something that could ease the pains and needs of
    therapists. This motivation was due to my observation of the daily
    difficulties of therapists and the inadequacy of current solutions. I called
    the project “Inspiring Care”.
  </p>
  <h3>The problem</h3>
  <div class="textimg-grid">
    <div class="textimg-row">
      <div class="textimg-col">
        <ul>
          <li>Therapists often complain about having no time to manage their cases and individual therapeutic process. This management includes daily records for each session, assessments and reassessments (that may include research to find the most adequate assessment tool for the client, score sheets, calculations, note taking and reports) and keep the intervention plan and goals updated.</li>
          <li>The complaints refer that they are encouraged to have as many therapy sessions as possible per day, which limits them to use the breaks between sessions or do non-paid overtime to keep up with the paper work. Scarce resources in workplaces, such as shared computers, further reduce their available time.</li>
          <li>Depending on the clients’ goals, therapist may work in diverse settings other than their physical workplace (like hospitals, clinics, or community health centres). They may travel to clients' homes, schools, equestrian centres or pools to conduct the therapy sessions, leading to busy schedules and travel time that cannot be repurposed.</li>
          <li>Additionally, the software used may not meet their specific needs or support multidisciplinary interventions.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="textimg-col">
        <img 
        src="/images/Escola.JPG"
        alt="An example of the office space available for therapists in a school setting"
      class="school-img"/>
      <p class="subtitle">A photograph I took during this research study of the office space available to therapists in a school context. Note the outdated hardware and the amount of physical files.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  <p>Thus, a generative study was considered to uncover needs and gather insights to be able to reach a viable, feasible and informed solution.</p>
  <h2>Preparation</h2>
<h3>Current process</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Therapists use an iterative therapeutic process such as the one exemplified below.</li>
</ul>
<img 
          src="/images/TherapeuticProcess.png"
          alt="A simplified version of a therapeutic process"
        class="thera-img"/>
    <ul>
        <li>This whole process needs to be documented extensively and each phase has different documentation needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Current software</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The current software used by therapists is either a customised one (made in-house by a developer), SClínico (the software made by the ministry of health) or an inexpensive solution found by the team (e.g. using Airtable with Google Docs).</li>
    <li>Other solutions were found (such as wClínicas, Hogrefe, Fisiozero and iCouch), but are specific to certain therapies and wouldn’t allow any sort of teamwork or multidisciplinary intervention.</li>
    <li>Other healthcare management solutions focus on doctors and nurses (e.g. SAM and SAPE). Therapists could be allowed to consult the records if needed (e.g. in a hospital setting), but couldn’t use the same software for their records.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secondary Research</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Scientific literature was consulted to check and compare the therapeutic process. It was found that occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech and language therapy and psychology use compatible therapeutic processes.</li>
    <li>Ideally, the assessment done by these professionals should contain scientifically validated assessment questionnaires and test batteries as assessment tools. However, during my desk research, I realised there is no centralised archive to access the scientifically validated assessment questionnaires for the Portuguese population. I found dozens of posts from therapists on social media asking if a certain questionnaire was already validated or not and how they could have access, which lead me to question if this may affect them and the impact it may have. With further research, I found that test batteries are sold by companies, but are hard to find and may not be affordable for some institutions. As such, I decided to make note of this to check if it came up as a pain or a need during the research.</li>
    <li>The scientific literature around interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary intervention that was consulted during desk research was not conclusive to find actual team needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Main research questions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What are the existing market solutions (offers, strengths, weaknesses)?</li>
    <li>How do therapists conduct a therapeutic process from beginning to end?</li>
    <li>How are therapists documenting their therapeutic process?</li>
    <li>What are the needs, pain points and motivations of therapists?</li>
    <li>How are therapists working as a team and what do they need to be able to do it in an efficient and effective way?</li>
    <li>What is a typical working day or week like for a therapist?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Planning</h2>
<p>To better get a grasp of the needs and pains of therapists during their daily practice, the following methods were selected:</p>

      <div class="tabs">
        <div class="tab">
          <input type="checkbox" id="chck1">
          <label class="tab-label" for="chck1">User Interviews</label>
          <div class="tab-content">
            <ul>
                <li>I selected this method so that I was able to ask therapists about their routines, about their therapeutic process, their pains and needs. Whenever possible, I would also observe the software they use and how they use it. Due to distance constraints, I wasn’t able to perform all of them in person and I had to adapt the plan to be able to do them remotely.</li>
                <li>Contextual inquiry would’ve been the most adequate method, but there were legal/administrative issues to be considered (mainly due to patient confidentiality). I wasn’t able to get authorization in a timely manner.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="tab">
          <input type="checkbox" id="chck2">
          <label class="tab-label" for="chck2">Focus Groups</label>
          <div class="tab-content">
            <ul>
                <li>Since multidisciplinary work and teamwork are good practices in the healthcare industry, I also considered running a few focus groups with already established workgroups to ask them about their therapeutic process, how they work as a team, their pains and needs.</li>
                <li>I was able to check their office space, what physical resources they have available there, the software they use and where/how they keep their records. Patient confidentiality was kept at all times.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="tab">
            <input type="checkbox" id="chck3">
            <label class="tab-label" for="chck3">Competitive Analysis</label>
            <div class="tab-content">
                <ul>
                    <li>After the interviews/focus groups, since there was no common ground regarding the tools used (all interviewees used different tools depending on their workplace) and there was a need to use this research on a business plan, I considered it necessary to complement the information with market analysis and competitive analysis.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
<h3>Recruitment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Participants matching one of four profiles (occupational therapist, speech and language therapist, physical therapist and psychologist) were recruited on social media.</li>
    <li>The target audience should live in Portugal and be an active therapist (no retired therapists or therapists that are working in other fields, such as teaching).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Budget/Incentives</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Incentives weren’t available since it was an unpaid study.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Execution</h2>
<div class="methods-row">
  <div class="methods-col">
<h3>User Interviews</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Semi-structured interviews</li>
      <li>1 hour in-person or remote sessions (in total, there were 5 in-person, 6 remote)</li>
      <li>11 therapists (4 occupational therapists, 2 psychologists, 2 physical therapists, 3 speech and language therapists)</li>
      <li>Notes were taken during the interviews, including answers and observations</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="methods-col">
<h3>Focus Groups</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 hour in-person sessions</li>
      <li>Two sessions with different groups:
        <ul>
          <li>A team of 3 occupational therapists working in the same department</li>
          <li>A multidisciplinary therapist team of 5 working in the same institution (psychologist, 2 speech and language therapists, occupational therapist, physical therapist)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>o	Notes were taken during the interviews, including answers, main points of discussion and observations</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="methods-col">
<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Throughout online research</li>
      <li>Compared over 10 different software (including those reported in interviews/focus groups) using more than 14 criteria</li>
      <li>Notes and screenshots were taken during the research</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<h3>Analysis and refinement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The thematic analysis was done by hand, using pen and paper</li>
  <li>Compiled the data about tools/software in charts to be used in the competitive analysis</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Existing software lacks consideration for multidisciplinary intervention, as it confines different areas in silos. Therapists feel the need to be aware of their colleagues' interventions to enhance efficiency and mutual support, resulting in regular team meetings that take away time from their clients.</li>
  <li>Therapists feel neglected and undervalued in healthcare management software, being secondary to other healthcare professionals. They often have to adjust their processes to fit existing tools rather than utilising their ideal methods as documented by scientific literature.</li>
  <li>Time inefficiency is a significant issue, as therapists cannot utilize time away from the office for record-keeping. Absent clients during off-site sessions lead to wasted time. Thus, mobility and cross-device software are highly valued, as well as automation tools such as reminders to reduces absences.</li>
  <li>Due to time constraints related to the program I was participating in and the deliverables I was asked to add to my business plan, I had to prioritise the report and the competitive analysis. A task analysis and a customer journey map would’ve been adequate deliverables for this project. </li>

<h3>Synthesis</h3>
<p>In order to address the pains and needs related with managing the therapists’ practice and therapeutic processes and the time inefficiencies reported, the following insights were found:</p>
<div class="insight-grid">
  <div class="insight-row">
    <div class="insight-col">
      <ul>
        <li>Mobility
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding:</strong> Participants reported having more than one context of intervention (between two to six different contexts at a time during a work week) and being away from the office space. They were unable to keep up with the daily records due to several constraints, including not having enough computers in their department/office. Therapists that work in different settings where the clients also travel to meet them (e.g. in an external equestrian centre or community pool) also reported that, in the case the client misses their appointment, that time can’t be reused.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> The product should be cross-device (both mobile and computer) to allow therapists to use their time more efficiently and not be dependent on the availability of the few computers in the departments. That way, they can do their daily records without having to rely on shared resources or where they currently are.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="insight-col">
      <ul>
        <li>Digitalising the process
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding:</strong> Digitalisation is still underway in many of the therapists’ workplaces and there are a lot of external reports and other paper reports that should be archived. Therapists reported that keeping the clinical records up-to-date is an exhausting task.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Along with providing a digital clinical record, it should be possible to take photos (of the clients’ progress, external reports, etc) and archive them with the clients’ file, reducing the need for paper, for physical archives and the time expended with administrative work.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="insight-col">
      <ul>
        <li>Assisting the practice
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding:</strong> Formal assessments using battery tests and questionnaires are time consuming, especially during the scoring and analysis part. They are still done by hand and in paper, which forces the therapists to use a scanner to add the score sheet to the clinical records.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Digitalising the therapeutic assessment and facilitating this part of the therapeutic process (e.g. by calculating scores automatically) would allow them to use more formal assessment instead of relying on mostly observation.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="insight-col">
      <ul>
        <li>Centralised marketplace/community
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding:</strong> Therapists often rely on the community to be able to have access to formal assessments (such as questionnaires and test batteries). For example, they reach out to other therapists to ask for certain questionnaires, to verify if a certain formal assessment is already validated for the Portuguese population or to ask where to purchase a certain test battery.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Offer access to a digital archive of questionnaires and test batteries validated to the Portuguese population and to a thematic marketplace where they can purchase what they may need for their daily practice.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="insight-col">
      <ul>
        <li>Reports
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding:</strong> Therapists need to write reports for various ends (e.g. if the therapist works in a school, the end of the school year is always full of reports about the progress that was made). It can occupy a significant part of their time and having to do it after their work schedule or at home, where it affects their personal lives.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> In order to prevent overtime and “homework”, a functionality to generate reports should be designed using the scores from assessments/reassessments, the clinical information available. This report generation should have customisable templates that can be selected and should generate an editable report so that changes can be made if needed.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="insight-col">
      <ul>
        <li>Automation
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding:</strong> Therapists have to schedule their clients manually and mistakes can be made during the scheduling. They also report that clients often miss their sessions due to forgetfulness.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> The product should allow the automatic scheduling of the sessions (e.g. client x comes every Friday at 10am for 1 hour of physical therapy and 1 hour occupational therapy and it appears on their schedule right away). As a way to reduce clients’ absences, it should also be possible to send reminders.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>In order to address the pains and needs related with multidisciplinarity and teamwork, the following insights were found:</p>
<div class="insight-grid">
  <div class="insight-row">
    <div class="insight-col">
      <ul>
        <li>Collaboration
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding:</strong> Participants value multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity and are unwilling to compromise those to make sure they provide the best services they can. As such, they have to schedule regular team meetings (some do weekly meetings, others do them every two weeks). These meetings take quite a while (all the teams reported using a full morning or a full afternoon for that purpose) and it’s time away from their clients.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> The product should promote collaboration whenever possible (e.g. shared schedule and shared clinical records).</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="insight-col">
      <ul>
        <li>Sharing just enough
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding:</strong> Even though therapists feel the need to work as a team and share their work with each other, they reported that some notes should remain completely private from the other professional (e.g. things said in confidence during a session that the client may not yet be comfortable sharing with the team).</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Allow clinical notes and assessments to be kept confidential from the team to be shared at a more convenient time.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>
    </div>

        <li>Based on my research, it was decided to make a new product with cross-functionality and having in mind the requirements and needs gathered during the process.</li>

<h3>Results</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The research was used on the business plan and on several presentations about the project. The business plan was evaluated with a final score of 4.35/5 by StartUp Portugal (the jury during the “Empreende Já” program) and it was one of the chosen projects to receive funding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Takeways</h2>
<p>There were several limitations during this project that I have reflected upon.</p>
<div class="insight-grid">
  <div class="insight-row">
    <div class="insight-col">
      <ul>
        <li>Budget/recruitment
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> This was an unpaid study, so it was harder to find participants that were willing to participate.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I reached out to a couple of people that were willing to participate and asked them if they could share with their own networks. Fortunately, it opened up a few opportunities (for example, one of the focus groups). In a future project, incentives should be considered. </li>
            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> The recruitment was done on my social media only, so, along with having no incentive, I also had to rely a lot on willingness and those I had a relationship with.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I had to post in a few Facebook groups to be able to have a broader reach.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="insight-col">
      <ul>
        <li>Bias
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> I had to face my own confirmation bias, since I had worked as a therapist before and I had years of observations in my head.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I had to accept that we all have our biases. After all, we are only human. The best we can do is trying to be as neutral as possible, as much as we can, and be critical of our own work to make sure that our opinions and views stay out of our research.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="insight-col">
      <ul>
        <li>Administrative/legal limitations
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> The best method I could’ve used for this research was contextual inquiry. Unfortunately, that wasn’t possible due to administrative matters. I needed authorisation to be able to visit the workplaces so that patient confidentiality was kept.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I used user interviews instead of contextual inquiry whenever I was unable to get an authorisation in time. In a future project, I would recommend starting this task a lot sooner since it depends on external parties and it may impact our timelines/methods.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="insight-col">
      <ul>
        <li>Programme needs and time limitation
          <ul>
