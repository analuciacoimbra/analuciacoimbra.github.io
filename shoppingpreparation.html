    Beyond the Shopping List: Understanding Grocery Preparation Habits and
    Behaviours
  </h1>

  <h2>Context:</h2>
  <p>
    In 2024/25, after a period of self-study to learn new skills and
    responsibilities (focusing mainly on UX Research and related topics), I
    decided to volunteer my time and expertise. That way, I would be able to
    consolidate my knowledge and gain more practical experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    During that time, I found a freelance project on social media about grocery
    shopping and price comparison that I found very interesting. As such, I
    contacted those responsible for the aforementioned project (hereinafter
    referred to as stakeholders) to offer my services as a volunteer UX
    Researcher. My only requirement was to be able to use this experience in my
    portfolio as a case study whilst keeping the most sensitive information
    confidential, which was promptly accepted.
  </p>
  <h3>The problem</h3>
  <div class="textimg-grid">
    <div class="textimg-row">
      <div class="textimg-col">
        <ul>
          <li>
            The project originated from the stakeholders' needs. They wanted to
            build a tool that helped them analyse if the current price for a
            product was the cheapest they could pay or if they could find the
            item cheaper somewhere else.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are many supermarkets and promotions happening all the time,
            which makes it harder to track the base price for the products for
            each one of them.
          </li>
          <li>
            From the stakeholders’ perspective, some of the promotions seemed to
            be misleading: as in, the stores would raise the effective current
            price of the item so they could offer the base price as a promotion.
            These tactics are hard to notice unless they have data from previous
            time frames to compare. This prompted the creation of this tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            With the rise of global inflation in the post-COVID-19 era, the
            stakeholders recognised the potential utility of this project for
            the general public, whilst lacking any concrete information or
            research about the needs of this potential target audience.

          with some prices highlighted in yellow. Several items are crossed out,
          and sticky notes with additional shopping items are visible in a pink

  </div>
  <p>
    After a meeting with the stakeholders, I proposed advancing with generative
    research to understand user needs and shopping behaviours, rather than
    immediately proceeding with evaluative research on an existing solution, in
    order to ensure alignment between the project and user needs and to inform
    future project decisions.
  </p>
  <h2>Preparation</h2>
  <h3>Business/project goals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Stakeholders were interviewed regarding project goals and research
      expectations. Across the board, the stakeholders’ main ambition for this
      project is to positively impact people by providing a tool that allows
      them to effectively save money and access better deals.
    </li>
    <li>
      To systematically identify research needs, I facilitated a Knowledge
      Quadrant exercise, as proposed by Debbie Levitt. We used a shared Miro
      board during our meeting and finalised it asynchronously by an agreed
      deadline.
    </li>
    <li>
      A preliminary analysis of the research needs was performed and the
      questions were tagged accordingly (questions that UX Research could answer
      and questions that should be answered by data analytics). The data
      analytics questions were considered out of scope for this generative
      research study.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <img
    src="/images/KnowledgeQuadrant.png"
    alt="A filled Knowledge Quadrant, as proposed by Debbie Levitt"
    class="knowledgeq-img"
  />
  <ul>
    <li>
      The completed quadrant served as the foundation for our research questions
      and helped maintain stakeholder alignment throughout the investigation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Existing Research/Software/Process</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      There was no previous research and no information about current software
      or processes used by the possible target audience, which further
      emphasised the need to explore these areas in our study.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Secondary Research</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Before moving forward with planning, I conducted targeted secondary
      research to:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Identify existing information that might answer some of our research
        questions
      </li>
      <li>Establish baseline understanding about potential target audiences</li>
      <li>Define potential guidelines for the primary research</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Key findings included:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Grocery shopping preparation is predominantly done by women (9 out of 10
        people), who also typically do the shopping afterwards.
      </li>
      <li>
        During this inflationary period, 6 out of 10 Portuguese consumers were
        using grocery shopping lists, higher than in previous years, primarily
        to control expenses and reduce impulse purchases.
      </li>
      <li>
        Media coverage showed that despite government initiatives like "IVA
        Zero" (Zero VAT) for essential items, prices continued to rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        People were adapting by reducing non-essential spending, exploring
        alternative shopping venues like local markets, and making more frequent
        but smaller shopping trips.
      </li>
      <li>
        Several potential competing tools were identified, highlighting the need
        for competitive analysis.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      With these findings, it’s possible to conclude that there could be market
      demand for the proposed tool, while also identifying potential competitors
      that would require further investigation.
    </li>
    <li>
      This information was compiled in a table on Miro with the main takeaways
      of each article/study and respective sources to be consulted as needed.

  <h2>Planning</h2>
  <p>
    The following research methods were selected to address the research
    questions:
  </p>
  <div class="tabs">
    <div class="tab">
      <input type="checkbox" id="chck1" />
      <label class="tab-label" for="chck1"
        >User Interviews with Observations</label
      >
      <div class="tab-content">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Selected as the primary methodology to gather user data due to time
            and location constraints. Interviews needed to be conducted within
            project timeframes while capturing input from a diverse pool of
            participants across Portugal, representing various age groups,
            genders, and including people with permanent and temporary
            impairments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whenever possible and necessary, observation was also used by
            prompting the interviewees to show their current processes and apps
            they use, including how they use them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contextual inquiry for each of the sub-tasks would have been the
            most adequate method to observe people in their own settings and
            contexts whilst performing the task. The users' performance may vary
            according to the setting (for example, doing the task in a
            controlled environment versus their own environment) and that is
            something that may add a new layer of complexity and detail.
            However, as this was a volunteer position with no budget available
            and significant time constraints, this approach was unfeasible
            despite being methodologically better.

        >Social Media Research and Survey</label
      >
      <div class="tab-content">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Conducted research across social media platforms to gather data on
            user preferences, including the most preferred supermarkets and
            their perceived quality tier lists.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deployed a survey to collect additional quantitative data on
            shopping habits and preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            This combined data was critical for establishing implementation
            priorities, such as which supermarkets to add to the app first based
            on user preference rankings and perceived quality.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Preparing the shopping list and then going shopping with it,
            although an apparently simple task, is very complex given the task
            dimensions. It is, above all, very cognitively demanding as it may
            require knowing criteria such as family/personal preferences,
            previous prices and mental arithmetic.
          </li>
          <li>
            As such, task analysis was conducted so that this cognitive load and
            knowledge dependencies could be mapped.
          </li>
          <li>
            Along with the task analysis mapping, user knowledge profiles and a
            task optimisation mapping were included.

          <li>
            During secondary research, seemingly similar tools were found. That
            was the primary reason for including this methodology.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, another iteration was needed when none of the users
            interviewed reported using the tools found during secondary
            research. Even though they weren't considered competition at first
            glance, since those were the users' choices, more analysis was
            required.
          </li>
          <li>
            Said tools were compared to the currently existing project to find
            commonalities, differences and how they answer the users' needs,
            pains and motivations.

  <h3>Recruitment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Participants were recruited on social media using a screener. The target
      audience should live in Portugal and do any sort of preparation before
      going shopping.
    </li>
    <li>
      The screener allowed us to define criteria such as different efforts in
      the preparation (simple or extensive preparation) or going to one or more
      supermarkets, which was critical for the study considering the discovered
      behavioural typologies (or user knowledge profiles/personas) during the
      interviews.
    </li>
    <li>
      From over 90 potential respondents, approximately 40 were selected to
      ensure diversity across age groups, locations, occupations, genders, and
      including people with permanent and temporary impairments.
    </li>
    <li>
      It was possible to get a large and diverse pool of participants, allowing
      further refinement and detail in the user knowledge profiles.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Budget/Incentives</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Incentives weren’t available since it was an unpaid study.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Alignment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      After finishing the research preparation and planning, the team had a
      meeting to align expectations and approve the research plan to start as
      soon as possible.

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Confirming the Need:</b> The research confirmed that preparing for
      grocery shopping is common practice among the Portuguese population.
      Secondary research had already suggested that a small majority do this,
      which was reinforced when 81,9% of our survey respondents reported doing
      some sort of preparation. Most importantly, saving money emerged as the
      primary motivation, mentioned by every single interviewee, which validates
      the core purpose of this project.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Gap in Current Solutions:</b> Despite several existing tools in the
      market, none of them fully address the needs uncovered during this
      investigation—not even the ones our interviewees currently use. This
      forces people to spend more time preparing for grocery shopping and to
      settle for whatever tools they can find to reduce their pain points as
      much as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Research Informing Design and Development:</b> By conducting thorough
      research with different user types, I was able to uncover many important
      needs, frustrations, motivations and preferences. These findings now
      provide a solid foundation for the team to improve the existing solution,
      hopefully creating something that better meets people's needs and
      genuinely helps them save money during this challenging economic period.

  <h3>Synthesis</h3>
  <p>
    In order to address the pains and needs related to the whole process of
    preparing the grocery shopping list and the inevitable shopping trip, I
    analysed and synthesised all the data into insights following structured
    approach with findings and actionable recommendations. There were insights
    covering 8 different main themes, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Preparing for the shopping trip</li>
    <li>Task delegation</li>
    <li>Decision-making</li>
    <li>Cost control</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As an example, I'll share one of the key insights.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Task delegation
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Finding:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In addition to frequent shoppers and non-frequent shoppers,
              several interviewees mentioned that they don't always do the
              shopping themselves, although they always prepare the shopping
              trip. Some of the reasons reported were illness, recovery from an
              accident/childbirth and convenience (for example, their partner
              being closer to the shopping venue or their own unavailability).
              However, due to the other person's lack of experience, they have
              to do extra work detailing the products (for instance, instead of
              writing 'milk', they have to specify 'a carton of Agros
              semi-skimmed milk'). If they need to use vouchers, they also have
              to add a note.
            </li>
            <li>
              It was also reported that this person is often unaware of the
              family's usual/preferred brands and which products can be
              substituted for others or which should not be purchased if they
              are not in stock/on promotion.
            </li>
            <li>
              The usual consequences of not providing sufficient detail are
              constant phone calls to confirm information and the purchase of
              unnecessary or unsuitable products, creating frustration for both
              parties and extending both the time and expenses required to
              complete the shopping task.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recommendation:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To reduce the pain points related to the delegation of the
              shopping task, the following improvements are suggested:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <u>Contextual Notes:</u> Enable the possibility of adding notes
                to the shopping list (for example, to note down possible
                vouchers to use)
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>Product-Specific Instructions:</u> Provide the option of
                adding notes per product (for example, to add information about
                possible replacement products or important details about the
                product) and saving those product notes as editable user
                preferences to be reused in future shopping trips
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>Collaborative Shopping:</u> Allow sharing the shopping list
                with the possibility of crossing off products already placed in
                the basket or already purchased
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>Real-time Synchronisation:</u> Ensure the shopping list of
                the "organiser" and the "shopper" remains synchronised
                throughout the shopping journey
              </li>
              <li>
                <u>Customisable Units:</u> Enable customising the units to be
                purchased (for example, '10 slices of ham') to reduce ambiguity
                for the shopper
              </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Alignment (with the team)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The research findings were presented to stakeholders (developers) in
            a dedicated meeting and subsequently shared for future reference and
            implementation guidance.

          <li>
            The prioritisation matrix then became the central focus of the
            discussion. Since not all suggestions could be assessed for
            technical feasibility during the meeting, the matrix was shared for
            asynchronous completion by team members when they had the capacity
            to evaluate them.

  <h2>Takeways</h2>

  <h3>What was learned from this experience</h3>

  <p>
    There are several key lessons derived from this research that I would
    approach differently in future research:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Most notably, the fourth user knowledge profile warrants deeper
      investigation (to note: this profile refers to friends or family members
      who do the shopping part of the task but lack familiarity with household
      preferences).
      <p>
        While I captured insights about their needs indirectly through
        interviews with list creators (who have experience with them and know
        how to make a list that meets their needs as much as possible), direct
        conversations with these proxy shoppers would have provided valuable
        complementary perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        These individuals require specially detailed lists precisely because
        they don't possess the product knowledge that list creators have. Due to
        project constraints, I couldn't conduct separate recruitment for this
        cohort. In future studies, I would implement a snowball sampling
        technique, asking primary participants if their shopping helpers might
        be available for brief interviews, creating a more holistic view of this
        interdependent shopping ecosystem.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      The interview process became quite iterative in nature, which proved
      insightful. Initial interviews revealed distinct behavioural patterns that
      prompted me to strategically recruit additional participants to ensure
      proper representation across emerging user profiles.
      <p>
        While this flexible approach was feasible within a volunteer study
        context, I recognise that, in a professional setting with incentive
        budgets and tight deadlines, such adaptation would require careful
        planning and stakeholder alignment. This flexibility ultimately
        strengthened the findings as the investigation began without a clearly
        defined target audience.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <p>
    There were several limitations during this project that I have reflected
    upon.
  </p>
  <div class="insight-grid">
    <div class="insight-row">
      <div class="insight-col">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Budget/recruitment
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Problem:</strong> As an unpaid study conducted during
                the summer months, recruitment proved difficult. Some email
                communications were flagged as spam, and many potential
                participants were unavailable after completing the screener due
                to holiday schedules.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> I expanded the initial recruitment
                pool and continued sending invitations until I had at least the
                minimum number required for each group/typology. For future
                projects, I would consider seasonal timing more carefully and
                advocate for participant incentives to improve response rates.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Delays
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Problem:</strong> Several factors extended the project
                beyond initial timelines: prolonged recruitment periods due to
                seasonal availability, expanded interview sample to accommodate
                emerging behavioural typologies, and unforeseen health
                considerations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Transparent communication with
                stakeholders proved effective. As all stakeholders were
                contributing to the project alongside full-time employment, they
                understood the situation and accommodated necessary timeline
                adjustments.

                <strong>Problem:</strong> Spontaneous ideas occurring outside
                dedicated project work time were occasionally lost due to
                inconsistent documentation practices.

                <strong>Solution:</strong> I've since implemented a
                comprehensive note-taking system using both physical and digital
                formats (using Google Keep, for example) to capture insights
                regardless of context or location.

                <strong>Problem:</strong> Automated transcription services
                struggled with European Portuguese, requiring substantial manual
                corrections.

                <strong>Solution:</strong> After testing multiple options, I
                selected Dovetail as the most accurate solution, though it still
                required some adjustments. For future non-English interviews,
                I'll investigate emerging AI-based transcription tools with
                better language support.
