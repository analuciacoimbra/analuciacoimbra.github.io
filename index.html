        Hello! I'm Ana Lúcia and welcome to my portfolio!
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm a UX researcher who uncovers the insights that drive better product
        and service decisions. I specialise in systematic research that reveals
        what users actually need, combining methods like interviews, task
        analysis and competitive research to deliver actionable findings. My
        background in healthcare and tech gives me a unique lens for
        understanding human behaviour and translating complex user needs into
        clear strategic recommendations.

        A comprehensive generative research study conducted in 2024/25 as a UX
        Researcher to understand user behaviours, needs and pain points in
        grocery shopping preparation. The research explored how people decide
        where to shop, manage budgets and leverage promotions. Findings informed
        the development of a price comparison tool that helps users save money
        by tracking product prices across different supermarkets.

        A generative study I carried out during my participation in the
        "Empreende Já" initiative (an entrepreneurship programme) in 2017, which
        allowed me to better understand the pains and needs of therapists. This
        study was used as the basis for the business plan presented at the end
        of the programme under the project name "Inspiring Care".
