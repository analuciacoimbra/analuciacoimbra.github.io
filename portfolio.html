      <h2>How do therapists manage their daily practice?</h2>
      <p>
        A generative study I carried out during my participation in the
        "Empreende JÃ¡" initiative (an entrepreneurship programme), which allowed
        me to better understand the pains and needs of therapists. This study
        was used as the basis for the business plan presented at the end of the
        programme under the project name "Inspiring Care".
