  <h2>Context:</h2>
  <p>
    In 2017/18, during my participation in the “Empreende Já” program (a
    Portuguese entrepreneurship program that is conducted by IPDJ, the
    governmental agency for youth and sports), each participant had classes
    related to business and, afterwards, would have to present a business plan
    to be evaluated by a jury.
  </p>
  <p>
    I joined the program to be able to learn more about
    business/entrepreneurship, since it was something I was interested in, and
    possibly develop something that could ease the pains and needs of
    therapists. This motivation was due to my observation of the daily
    difficulties of therapists and the inadequacy of current solutions. I called
    the project “Inspiring Care”.
  </p>
  <h3>The problem</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Therapists often complain about having no time to manage their cases and individual therapeutic process. This management includes daily records for each session, assessments and reassessments (that may include research to find the most adequate assessment tool for the client, score sheets, calculations, note taking and reports) and keep the intervention plan and goals updated.</li>
    <li>The complaints refer that they are encouraged to have as many therapy sessions as possible per day, which limits them to use the breaks between sessions or do non-paid overtime to keep up with the paper work. Scarce resources in workplaces, such as shared computers, further reduce their available time.</li>
    <li>Depending on the clients’ goals, therapist may work in diverse settings other than their physical workplace (like hospitals, clinics, or community health centres). They may travel to clients' homes, schools, equestrian centres or pools to conduct the therapy sessions, leading to busy schedules and travel time that cannot be repurposed.</li>
    <li>Additionally, the software used may not meet their specific needs or support multidisciplinary interventions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thus, a generative study was considered to uncover needs and gather insights to be able to reach a viable, feasible and informed solution.</p>
  <h2>Preparation</h2>
<h3>Current process</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Therapists use an iterative therapeutic process such as the one exemplified below.</li>
</ul>
<img 
          src="/images/TherapeuticProcess.png"
          alt="A simplified version of a therapeutic process"
        class="thera-img"/>
    <ul>
        <li>This whole process needs to be documented extensively and each phase has different documentation needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Current software</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The current software used by therapists is either a customised one (made in-house by a developer), SClínico (the software made by the ministry of health) or an inexpensive solution found by the team (e.g. using Airtable with Google Docs).</li>
    <li>Other solutions were found (such as wClínicas, Hogrefe, Fisiozero and iCouch), but are specific to certain therapies and wouldn’t allow any sort of teamwork or multidisciplinary intervention.</li>
    <li>Other healthcare management solutions focus on doctors and nurses (e.g. SAM and SAPE). Therapists could be allowed to consult the records if needed (e.g. in a hospital setting), but couldn’t use the same software for their records.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secondary Research</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Scientific literature was consulted to check and compare the therapeutic process. It was found that occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech and language therapy and psychology use compatible therapeutic processes.</li>
    <li>Ideally, the assessment done by these professionals should contain scientifically validated assessment questionnaires and test batteries as assessment tools. However, during my desk research, I realised there is no centralised archive to access the scientifically validated assessment questionnaires for the Portuguese population. I found dozens of posts from therapists on social media asking if a certain questionnaire was already validated or not and how they could have access, which lead me to question if this may affect them and the impact it may have. With further research, I found that test batteries are sold by companies, but are hard to find and may not be affordable for some institutions. As such, I decided to make note of this to check if it came up as a pain or a need during the research.</li>
    <li>The scientific literature around interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary intervention that was consulted during desk research was not conclusive to find actual team needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Main research questions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What are the existing market solutions (offers, strengths, weaknesses)?</li>
    <li>How do therapists conduct a therapeutic process from beginning to end?</li>
    <li>How are therapists documenting their therapeutic process?</li>
    <li>What are the needs, pain points and motivations of therapists?</li>
    <li>How are therapists working as a team and what do they need to be able to do it in an efficient and effective way?</li>
    <li>What is a typical working day or week like for a therapist?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Planning</h2>
<p>To better get a grasp of the needs and pains of therapists during their daily practice, the following methods were selected:</p>

      <div class="tabs">
        <div class="tab">
          <input type="checkbox" id="chck1">
          <label class="tab-label" for="chck1">User Interviews</label>
          <div class="tab-content">
            <ul>
                <li>I selected this method so that I was able to ask therapists about their routines, about their therapeutic process, their pains and needs. Whenever possible, I would also observe the software they use and how they use it. Due to distance constraints, I wasn’t able to perform all of them in person and I had to adapt the plan to be able to do them remotely.</li>
                <li>Contextual inquiry would’ve been the most adequate method, but there were legal/administrative issues to be considered (mainly due to patient confidentiality). I wasn’t able to get authorization in a timely manner.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="tab">
          <input type="checkbox" id="chck2">
          <label class="tab-label" for="chck2">Focus Groups</label>
          <div class="tab-content">
            <ul>
                <li>Since multidisciplinary work and teamwork are good practices in the healthcare industry, I also considered running a few focus groups with already established workgroups to ask them about their therapeutic process, how they work as a team, their pains and needs.</li>
                <li>I was able to check their office space, what physical resources they have available there, the software they use and where/how they keep their records. Patient confidentiality was kept at all times.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="tab">
            <input type="checkbox" id="chck3">
            <label class="tab-label" for="chck3">Competitive Analysis</label>
            <div class="tab-content">
                <ul>
                    <li>After the interviews/focus groups, since there was no common ground regarding the tools used (all interviewees used different tools depending on their workplace) and there was a need to use this research on a business plan, I considered it necessary to complement the information with market analysis and competitive analysis.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
<h3>Recruitment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Participants matching one of four profiles (occupational therapist, speech and language therapist, physical therapist and psychologist) were recruited on social media.</li>
    <li>The target audience should live in Portugal and be an active therapist (no retired therapists or therapists that are working in other fields, such as teaching).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Budget/Incentives</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Incentives weren’t available since it was an unpaid study.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Execution</h2>
<div class="methods-row">
  <div class="methods-col">
<h3>User Interviews</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Semi-structured interviews</li>
      <li>1 hour in-person or remote sessions (in total, there were 5 in-person, 6 remote)</li>
      <li>11 therapists (4 occupational therapists, 2 psychologists, 2 physical therapists, 3 speech and language therapists)</li>
      <li>Notes were taken during the interviews, including answers and observations</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="methods-col">
<h3>Focus Groups</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 hour in-person sessions</li>
      <li>Two sessions with different groups:
        <ul>
          <li>A team of 3 occupational therapists working in the same department</li>
          <li>A multidisciplinary therapist team of 5 working in the same institution (psychologist, 2 speech and language therapists, occupational therapist, physical therapist)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>o	Notes were taken during the interviews, including answers, main points of discussion and observations</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="methods-col">
<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Throughout online research</li>
      <li>Compared over 10 different software (including those reported in interviews/focus groups) using more than 14 criteria</li>
      <li>Notes and screenshots were taken during the research</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<h3>Analysis and refinement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The thematic analysis was done by hand, using pen and paper</li>
  <li>Compiled the data about tools/software in charts to be used in the competitive analysis</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Existing software lacks consideration for multidisciplinary intervention, as it confines different areas in silos. Therapists feel the need to be aware of their colleagues' interventions to enhance efficiency and mutual support, resulting in regular team meetings that take away time from their clients.</li>
  <li>Therapists feel neglected and undervalued in healthcare management software, being secondary to other healthcare professionals. They often have to adjust their processes to fit existing tools rather than utilising their ideal methods as documented by scientific literature.</li>
  <li>Time inefficiency is a significant issue, as therapists cannot utilize time away from the office for record-keeping. Absent clients during off-site sessions lead to wasted time. Thus, mobility and cross-device software are highly valued, as well as automation tools such as reminders to reduces absences.</li>
  <li>Due to time constraints related to the program I was participating in and the deliverables I was asked to add to my business plan, I had to prioritise the report and the competitive analysis. A task analysis and a customer journey map would’ve been adequate deliverables for this project. </li>
